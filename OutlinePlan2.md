## EPISODE 1: "Demystifying the CNAPP: Applying Vulnerability Management in the Cloud"
**Duration**: 45 minutes content + 15 minutes Q&A
**Objective**: Foundation setting - make cloud VM approachable while revealing complexity

### Opening (3 minutes)
**Host Introduction**
"Welcome everyone! I'm [Host], and whether you're drowning in cloud security alerts or just starting to move workloads to AWS, today we're going to cut through the confusion."

"With me is [Expert], who's helped hundreds of organizations figure out cloud security. We're going to have a conversation - not a lecture - about what actually matters."

"Quick ground rules: Drop questions in chat anytime. We'll address them as we go. Use the polls - they're anonymous. And if you're an expert and think we're going too basic, stick around - we'll be layering in advanced content throughout."

**Setting Expectations**
"We're covering five big questions today. By the end, you'll understand why traditional security breaks in the cloud, what a CNAPP actually does, and most importantly - where to start Monday morning."

---

### Question 1: "What does 'security best practice' actually mean in a cloud-native world?"
**Target time**: 8 minutes
**Breach story**: Capital One (2019)
**Engagement**: Poll on shared responsibility understanding

#### Breach Background: Capital One (2019)
**Date**: March-July 2019 (disclosed July 29, 2019)
**Scale**: 100 million US customers, 6 million Canadian customers affected. 140,000 Social Security numbers, 80,000 bank account numbers exposed.
**Attack Overview**: A former AWS employee exploited a misconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF) on an EC2 instance. Used Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to access the EC2 metadata service, obtained temporary security credentials, then accessed S3 buckets containing customer data.
**What Went Wrong**: 
- Overly permissive IAM role attached to WAF instance
- WAF misconfiguration allowing SSRF attacks
- S3 buckets accessible with the compromised credentials
- No network segmentation between WAF and sensitive data storage
- Lack of anomaly detection for unusual S3 access patterns

#### Beat Structure:

**HOOK** (Host - 30 seconds)
"Let's start with the phrase everyone uses but nobody defines - 'security best practice.' I know we're often asked by our customers to assist them in adhering to best practice, but in a world where infrastructure appears and disappears in seconds, what does it mean"?

**BEAT 1: The Rapid Elasticity Problem** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Animation showing servers spinning up/down with timestamp]*

"Here's what changed everything: NIST's principle of Rapid Elasticity. Your infrastructure is now ephemeral."

*Beginner layer*: "Imagine trying to guard a building where the doors and windows keep moving."

*Intermediate layer*: "That Azure VM you scanned yesterday? It's gone. Replaced by three containers that weren't there this morning."

*Expert nugget*: "And if you're using Azure Spot VMs or Container Instances, your infrastructure might exist for minutes, not months."

**BEAT 2: Capital One Breach Story** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Capital One breach timeline with technical diagram]*

"Let's talk about the Capital One breach - and why its an important teaching point, eventhough its quite an old breach at this point, it was in 2019.  

So, firstly, this wasn't some kind of sophisticated zero-day attack, or application layer breach"

*Progressive reveal on slide*:
1. Misconfigured WAF (Web Application Firewall)
2. Over-permissioned IAM role
3. SSRF attack to metadata service
4. Credential theft
5. S3 bucket access
6. 100 million records exposed

"The lesson? Every piece was a 'small' misconfiguration. Together, they created a highway to customer data."

*Expert insight*: "Notice the metadata service attack vector - that's why IMDSv2 enforcement is now critical."

**BEAT 3: Shared Responsibility Confusion** (Expert - 1.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Shared responsibility model - but animated to show confusion points]*

"Microsoft secures the cloud, you secure what's in the cloud. Sounds simple?"

*Reality check*: "Gartner says 99% of cloud breaches will be customer misconfigurations through 2025."

"It's like renting an apartment - the landlord maintains the building security, but if you leave your door open and post your address on Twitter..."

**BEAT 4: Identity as the New Perimeter** (Expert - 1.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Traditional perimeter vs cloud identity web]*

"Forget firewalls as your main defense. In cloud, identity IS your perimeter."

*Practical example*: "That service account you created for a quick test? If it has AdministratorAccess policy, it's a skeleton key to your kingdom."

**BEAT 5: From Checklist to Continuous** (Expert - 1 minute)
*[SLIDE: Continuous validation loop diagram]*

"Modern best practice isn't a checklist - it's continuous validation."

Quick wins for everyone:
- Beginners: "Enable Azure Activity Log and Microsoft Defender for Cloud today"
- Intermediate: "Implement Azure Policy for governance boundaries"
- Advanced: "Build Logic Apps for event-driven remediation"

**ENGAGEMENT BREAK** (Host - 30 seconds)
*[POLL: "What surprised you most about the Capital One breach?"]*
- The simplicity of the attack
- The IAM role issues
- That it could happen to a tech-savvy bank
- The metadata service vector

### Question 2: "CNAPP sounds like the final boss of acronyms, in an acronym heavy space. What is it, and what problem is it solving?"
**Target time**: 7 minutes
**Breach story**: Uber (2016) - Tool fragmentation blindness
**Engagement**: Chat prompt on tool sprawl

#### Breach Background: Uber (2016)
**Date**: October-November 2016 (disclosed November 2017)
**Scale**: 57 million users worldwide (25 million US), 600,000 US drivers' license numbers exposed
**Attack Overview**: Attackers found Uber engineer credentials on GitHub in a private repository. Used these to access Uber's AWS environment, specifically S3 buckets containing rider and driver data backups.
**What Went Wrong**:
- Credentials stored in code repository (even private ones are risky)
- No multi-factor authentication on cloud accounts
- Lack of secrets scanning in development workflow
- Fragmented security tools missed the unauthorized access
- Attempted cover-up (paid attackers $100,000 through bug bounty program)

#### Beat Structure:

**HOOK** (Host - 30 seconds)
"I think you'll know who I mean when I say one of our customers had 23 security tools being used in cloud environments across their enterprise. Twenty-three different dashboards, alert streams, and login screens. CNAPP promises to fix this. But is it real or just vendor hype?"

**BEAT 1: The Tool Sprawl Problem** (Expert - 1.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Dashboard chaos - 15 browser tabs of security tools]*

"Here's what most teams are dealing with:"
- SIEM for logs
- CSPM for misconfigs
- Vulnerability scanner for CVEs
- CWPP for workloads
- CIEM for identity
- Secret scanner
- Container scanner
- IaC scanner
- And they don't talk to each other

"You spend more time correlating alerts than fixing problems."

*Expert insight*: "And the real killer? Each tool has its own risk scoring. A 'critical' in one tool might be 'medium' in another."

**BEAT 2: The Uber Breach - Death by Fragmentation** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Uber breach attack path with tool blind spots marked]*

"Uber 2016 - Let me show you how tool fragmentation enabled this breach:"

1. GitHub credential scanner: Missed private repo
2. SIEM: Saw unusual access but no context
3. VM scanner: Not scanning GitHub
4. IAM tool: Didn't flag service account usage
5. Data loss prevention: No coverage on code repos

"Each tool did its job. But the attacker moved through the gaps between them."

"57 million records exposed because tools couldn't connect the dots."

**BEAT 3: What CNAPP Actually Is** (Expert - 1.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: CNAPP platform visualization - unified dashboard]*

"CNAPP isn't just bundling - it's correlation:"

*Simple explanation*: "One platform that sees everything and connects the dots"

*Technical depth*: 
- CSPM + CWPP + CIEM + IaC security
- Unified risk scoring
- Attack path analysis
- Integrated remediation

*Expert nugget*: "The key is the shared data model - when CSPM finds a misconfiguration, CWPP knows which workloads are affected, and CIEM shows who can exploit it."

**BEAT 4: The Power of Context** (Expert - 1.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Same CVE, different risk scores based on context]*

"Here's the same vulnerability in three places:"
1. Dev environment, internal only = Low risk
2. Production, but behind WAF = Medium risk  
3. Internet-facing, with admin credentials = CRITICAL

"CNAPP sees all three contexts and prioritizes accordingly."

**BEAT 5: Quick Reality Check** (Expert - 30 seconds)
"Is CNAPP perfect? No. But would Uber have been breached with unified visibility? Probably not."

**ENGAGEMENT BREAK** (Host - 30 seconds)
*[CHAT PROMPT: "Drop a number in chat - how many security tools does your team use today?"]*
Watch the numbers roll in - "Wow, seeing lots of 10+ here..."

### Question 3: "Why is vulnerability management so much harder in the cloud than on-prem?"
**Target time**: 8 minutes
**Breach story**: Tesla Kubernetes (2018) - Container blind spots
**Engagement**: Poll on biggest VM challenges

#### Breach Background: Tesla Kubernetes (2018)
**Date**: February 2018 (discovered by RedLock)
**Scale**: Unknown data exposure, primarily cryptomining impact on compute resources
**Attack Overview**: Kubernetes console left exposed to internet without password protection. Attackers accessed pods containing AWS credentials, used them to access S3 buckets with telemetry data, and installed cryptominers.
**What Went Wrong**:
- Kubernetes dashboard exposed without authentication
- Default settings not hardened
- AWS credentials stored in Kubernetes pods
- No network policies restricting pod access
- Container runtime not monitored for suspicious activity

#### Beat Structure:

**HOOK** (Host - 30 seconds)
"Traditional vulnerability management was already hard. You had patch Tuesday, quarterly scans, change windows. But at least servers stayed put. In the cloud? Everything we knew broke."

**BEAT 1: The Ephemeral Infrastructure Problem** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Container lifecycle - 12 minutes average lifespan]*

"Your scanner runs at 2 AM. By 2:15 AM, half your infrastructure is different."

*Beginner understanding*: "It's like trying to count cars on a highway - they keep moving"

*Real numbers*: 
- Average container lifespan: 12 minutes
- Lambda execution: 100 milliseconds  
- Auto-scaling events: Hundreds per day

*Expert insight*: "And if you're using Spot instances, you might have 2-minute warning before termination. Good luck patching that."

**BEAT 2: Tesla's Kubernetes Breach** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Tesla breach - Kubernetes dashboard exposure]*

"Tesla 2018 - Perfect example of cloud VM blind spots:"

*Progressive revelation*:
1. Kubernetes dashboard left exposed (no password)
2. Container credentials visible
3. Access to Azure environment
4. Cryptomining installed
5. But also: Telemetry data exposed

"Their traditional scanners? Never saw the Kubernetes layer. Never scanned the containers. Never checked the dashboard."

*Key lesson*: "Containers aren't VMs. They need different scanning approaches."

**BEAT 3: The Visibility Gap Matrix** (Expert - 1.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Coverage gaps - Agent vs Agentless vs API]*

"Here's what different scanning approaches actually see:"

|                    | Agent | Network | API-Based |
|--------------------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Long-lived VMs     | ✓     | ✓       | ✓         |
| Containers         | ~     | ✗       | ✓         |
| Container Images   | ✗     | ✗       | ✓         |
| Serverless         | ✗     | ✗       | ✓         |
| PaaS Services      | ✗     | ✗       | ✓         |

"If you're only using agents, you're blind to 60% of cloud infrastructure."

**BEAT 4: Context Changes Everything** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Risk calculation formula with real example]*

"A Log4j vulnerability in three places:"
1. Internal logging container: Medium risk
2. Customer-facing app server: High risk
3. Container with AWS root credentials: PANIC

"Cloud VM isn't just about finding vulns - it's about understanding blast radius."

*Advanced concept*: "Toxic combinations - when medium vulns + misconfigs = critical risk"

**BEAT 5: The Speed Solution** (Expert - 30 seconds)
"The answer? Shift from scanning to continuous visibility. APIs, admission control, runtime protection."

**ENGAGEMENT BREAK** (Host - 30 seconds)
*[POLL: "What's your biggest cloud VM challenge?"]*
- Can't keep up with changes
- Too many false positives
- Don't know what we have
- Can't get dev team buy-in

### Question 4: "How do I get visibility into my actual cloud risk?"
**Target time**: 7 minutes
**Breach story**: SolarWinds (2020) - Supply chain visibility
**Engagement**: Interactive risk scenario

#### Breach Background: SolarWinds (2020)
**Date**: March-December 2020 (disclosed December 13, 2020)
**Scale**: 18,000 organizations downloaded compromised updates, ~100 actively exploited
**Attack Overview**: Nation-state actors compromised SolarWinds' build environment, injected malicious code (SUNBURST) into Orion platform updates. Signed updates distributed to customers created backdoors into their environments.
**What Went Wrong**:
- Build environment compromised (weak password "solarwinds123")
- Code signing certificates used to sign malicious code
- Supply chain trust exploited
- Sophisticated hiding of command & control traffic
- Months of undetected presence in build systems

#### Beat Structure:

**HOOK** (Host - 30 seconds)
"Here's a scary question I ask every customer: 'Can you tell me every internet-facing asset you have right now?' The silence is deafening. If you don't know what you have, how can you protect it?"

**BEAT 1: The Inventory Problem** (Expert - 1.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Auto-discovery visualization - spreading web of resources]*

"Cloud resources have dependencies you don't see:"
- Launch one EC2 instance
- Creates ENI, security group, EBS volumes
- Maybe an ALB, target group, Route53 entry
- Each with its own permissions and exposure

"That's 7+ resources from one action. Multiply by your dev team."

*Reality check*: "Average enterprise has 40% 'shadow' resources they don't know about"

**BEAT 2: SolarWinds - The Ultimate Visibility Failure** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: SolarWinds attack chain - supply chain focus]*

"SolarWinds taught us that visibility isn't just about your resources:"

*The chain*:
1. Compromised build system (not visible)
2. Malicious update (signed, trusted)
3. 18,000 organizations affected
4. Cloud resources compromised via trusted path

"Your vulnerability scanners saw nothing wrong. The attack came through trust."

*Key insight*: "Cloud risk includes your supply chain - every container image, every marketplace AMI, every third-party integration"

**BEAT 3: Building Real Visibility** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Risk visibility pyramid - layers of context]*

"True visibility requires multiple layers:"

Foundation: Asset inventory (what exists)
Layer 2: Configuration state (how it's configured)
Layer 3: Vulnerability data (what's vulnerable)
Layer 4: Identity context (who can access)
Layer 5: Network exposure (what's reachable)
Layer 6: Data classification (what's at risk)
Top: Attack paths (how it connects)

"Most teams stop at layer 2. Real risk lives at layer 7."

**BEAT 4: Attack Path Visualization** (Expert - 1 minute)
*[SLIDE: Actual attack path example - simplified]*

"When you connect all the dots:"
Internet → Load Balancer → Web App (CVE) → IAM Role → Database → Customer Data

"Now you know which CVE to patch first."

**BEAT 5: Automation Is Non-Optional** (Expert - 30 seconds)
"Manual visibility in cloud is impossible. You need APIs, automation, continuous discovery."

**ENGAGEMENT BREAK** (Host - 30 seconds)
*[INTERACTIVE: Show a resource diagram]*
"Quick challenge: Spot the biggest risk in this architecture"
(Reveal: Public S3 bucket with IAM role access)

**Target time**: 8 minutes
**Success story**: Small fintech transformation
**Engagement**: Action plan builder

#### Beat Structure:

**HOOK** (Host - 30 seconds)
"Alright, we've covered a lot. But Monday morning, where do you actually start? Let's get practical."

**BEAT 1: The Visibility First Principle** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: 30-60-90 day roadmap]*

"Week 1: Discovery"
- Enable Azure Activity Log in all subscriptions
- Turn on Azure Policy and Security Center
- Run cloud asset discovery
- Document what you find

"You'll be shocked what you discover. One customer found 12 Bitcoin miners on their first scan."

*Beginner tip*: "Start with one AWS account. Get it right, then expand."
*Advanced tip*: "Implement CMDB federation immediately. Manual tracking will fail."

**BEAT 2: Quick Wins Strategy** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Quick wins checklist - visual]*

"Week 2-4: Easy victories"
- Close public S3 buckets (90% are mistakes)
- Enable MFA on all human accounts
- Rotate keys older than 90 days
- Enable default encryption
- Tag your resources (future you will thank you)

"These take hours, not weeks. ROI is immediate."

**BEAT 3: Success Story - 50-Person Fintech** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Before/after metrics dashboard]*

"Real customer, 50 employees, all-in on Azure:"

*Before*:
- 2000+ vulnerabilities
- 400+ misconfigurations
- No visibility into containers
- 3-person security team drowning

*90 days later*:
- 50 critical vulnerabilities (prioritized)
- Automated remediation for common issues
- Full container scanning
- Same 3 people, working strategic not tactical

"The key? They didn't try to fix everything. They fixed what mattered."

**BEAT 4: Tool Selection Criteria** (Expert - 1 minute)
*[SLIDE: Decision matrix for tools]*

"When evaluating solutions, ask:"
1. API-first or agent-required?
2. Multi-cloud or single cloud?
3. Developer-friendly or security-only?
4. Risk-based or severity-based?
5. Minutes to value or months to deploy?

"If it takes 6 months to deploy, cloud has already changed."

**BEAT 5: The Maturity Path** (Expert - 30 seconds)
*[SLIDE: Maturity model - crawl/walk/run]*

"Crawl: Visibility and basics (Month 1-3)"
"Walk: Automated scanning and prioritization (Month 4-9)"
"Run: Preventive controls and shift-left (Month 10+)"

"Don't try to run on day one."

**FINAL ENGAGEMENT** (Host - 30 seconds)
*[ACTION BUILDER: Poll series]*
"Let's build your action plan. First step you'll take:"
- Enable cloud logging
- Scan for public resources
- Implement MFA
- Evaluate CNAPP tools

### Closing (3 minutes)

**Host Wrap-up**
"We've covered a lot of ground today. Key takeaways:"
1. Cloud security isn't harder, it's different
2. Visibility must be continuous, not periodic
3. Context matters more than severity
4. Start small, win fast, then scale

**Expert Final Thought**
"If you remember one thing: In cloud, perfect security is impossible, but good enough security is achievable. Focus on what matters most to your business."

## EPISODE 2: "Rethinking Cloud Security: A Deep Dive into Cloud-Native Vulnerability Management"
**Duration**: 45 minutes content + 15 minutes Q&A
**Objective**: Advanced implementation - technical depth for practitioners

### Opening (3 minutes)
**Host Introduction**
"Welcome back! Or welcome if you're joining fresh. Today we're going deep - really deep - into cloud-native vulnerability management."

"Fair warning: We're going to get technical. We'll cover CSPM, CWPP, risk algorithms, and DevOps integration. If Episode 1 was 'what and why,' today is 'how and when.'"

---

### Question 1: "How does CSPM actually work under the hood?"
**Target time**: 9 minutes
**Breach story**: Microsoft Power Apps (2021) - Configuration drift
**Engagement**: Policy writing challenge

#### Breach Background: Microsoft Power Apps (2021)
**Date**: May 2021 discovery (misconfiguration existed since 2019)
**Scale**: 38 million records exposed across 47 organizations
**Attack Overview**: Default OData API settings in Power Apps portals were changed by Microsoft, making data publicly accessible. Organizations didn't realize their data was exposed through API endpoints.
**What Went Wrong**:
- Platform default changes not communicated effectively
- No automated posture scanning for Power Platform
- Configuration drift over time
- Organizations assumed platform defaults were secure
- Lack of API endpoint discovery and monitoring

#### Beat Structure:

**HOOK** (Host - 30 seconds)
"CSPM - Cloud Security Posture Management. Everyone says you need it. But what's actually happening when it scans your environment? Let's pop the hood."

**BEAT 1: The Policy Engine Architecture** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: CSPM architecture - API calls to policy evaluation]*

"CSPM is three components:"
1. Collectors: API calls to cloud providers
2. Policy engine: Rules evaluation
3. Remediation system: Fix or alert

*Technical detail*: "Collectors poll every 5-15 minutes using Reader role. Azure Policy events trigger immediate scans."

*Code example on slide*:
```python
# Simplified CSPM rule
def check_s3_encryption(bucket):
    if not bucket.encryption_enabled:
        return Violation(
            severity="HIGH",
            resource=bucket.arn,
            fix=enable_encryption(bucket)
        )
```

**BEAT 2: Microsoft Power Apps Breach** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Power Apps misconfiguration timeline]*

"Microsoft Power Apps 2021 - 38 million records exposed:"

*What happened*:
1. Default OData API settings changed
2. Portal permissions drifted to public
3. No posture scanning on Power Platform
4. Gradual exposure over months
5. Discovery by security researchers, not Microsoft

"Configuration drift - the silent killer. Settings correct on Monday, exposed by Friday."

**BEAT 3: Policy Frameworks Deep Dive** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: CIS vs NIST vs custom policies]*

"Pre-built vs custom policies:"

*CIS Benchmarks*: 300+ checks, prescriptive, one-size-fits-all
*NIST frameworks*: Risk-based, requires customization
*Custom policies*: Your specific requirements

"Pro tip: Start with CIS, layer your customs on top"

*Advanced*: "Use Open Policy Agent (OPA) for complex, multi-cloud policies"

**BEAT 4: The False Positive Problem** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Alert fatigue statistics]*

"Average CSPM deployment: 10,000+ findings on day one"

*The reality*:
- 60% are by design (dev environments)
- 30% are accepted risks
- 10% need fixing

"Suppression rules are your friend. Exception management is critical."

**BEAT 5: Automated Remediation** (Expert - 30 seconds)
*[SLIDE: Auto-remediation flowchart]*

"The end goal: Self-healing infrastructure"
- Detect drift
- Evaluate impact
- Auto-fix if safe
- Alert if risky

### Question 2: "What's different about Cloud Workload Protection?"
**Target time**: 9 minutes
**Breach story**: Docker Hub (2019) - Supply chain contamination
**Engagement**: Agent vs agentless debate

#### Breach Background: Docker Hub (2019)
**Date**: April 25, 2019
**Scale**: 190,000 accounts compromised (~5% of Hub users)
**Attack Overview**: Unauthorized access to Docker Hub database containing user information. Attackers accessed usernames, hashed passwords, GitHub/Bitbucket tokens for automated builds.
**What Went Wrong**:
- Single database compromise affected entire user base
- Tokens for connected services stored alongside user data
- Supply chain risk - compromised accounts could push malicious images
- Many official and popular images potentially at risk
- Users pulling images had no visibility into compromise

#### Beat Structure:

**HOOK** (Host - 30 seconds)
"The great debate: agents or agentless? Runtime or build-time? Let's settle this once and for all... or at least understand the tradeoffs."

**BEAT 1: Agent vs Agentless - The Real Story** (Expert - 2.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Comparison matrix with real metrics]*

"Let's be honest about both:"

*Agents*:
- Pros: Real-time, detailed, runtime protection
- Cons: Performance hit (3-7%), management overhead, container bloat

*Agentless*:
- Pros: No performance impact, easier deployment, full coverage
- Cons: Snapshot-based, no runtime protection, cloud API dependent

"The truth? You need both. Agentless for visibility, agents for critical workloads."

*Expert insight*: "eBPF is changing this game - near-zero overhead with kernel-level visibility"

**BEAT 2: Docker Hub Supply Chain Attack** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Docker Hub breach - contaminated images]*

"Docker Hub 2019 - 190,000 accounts compromised:"

*Attack chain*:
1. Official images compromised
2. Cryptominers injected
3. Pulled millions of times
4. Runtime detection caught some
5. But build-time scanning would have prevented all

"Lesson: Scan at every stage - registry, build, deploy, runtime"

**BEAT 3: Container Security Specifics** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Container attack surface diagram]*

"Containers aren't just small VMs:"
- Image vulnerabilities (inherited from base)
- Runtime configuration (capabilities, privileges)
- Orchestrator exposure (K8s API)
- Secret management (mounted volumes)
- Network policies (pod-to-pod)

*Code example*:
```dockerfile
# Bad
FROM ubuntu:latest
USER root

# Good
FROM ubuntu:22.04@sha256:abc...
USER nonroot
```

**BEAT 4: Runtime Protection Mechanisms** (Expert - 1.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Runtime protection in action]*

"What runtime protection actually does:"
- Behavioral analysis (is this container acting weird?)
- Drift detection (did something change post-deploy?)
- Active blocking (kill suspicious processes)

"Example: Container in AKS suddenly starts making DNS queries to cryptomining pools - blocked"

**BEAT 5: The Shift-Left Reality** (Expert - 30 seconds)
"Best vulnerability? One that never gets deployed. Scan in CI/CD, fail builds on critical findings."

**ENGAGEMENT** (Host - 30 seconds)
*[POLL: "What's your stance on agents?"]*
- Agents everywhere
- Agentless only
- Hybrid approach
- Still deciding

### Question 3: "How do I prioritize when everything is critical?"
**Target time**: 9 minutes
**Case study**: Fortune 500 prioritization success
**Engagement**: Risk scoring exercise

#### Beat Structure:

**HOOK** (Host - 30 seconds)
"Real customer quote: 'We have 50,000 critical vulnerabilities. Where do we even start?' Sound familiar?"

**BEAT 1: Why CVSS Fails in Cloud** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: CVSS score vs real risk]*

"CVSS was built for different world:"
- Assumes network adjacency
- Ignores cloud permissions
- No context awareness
- Static scoring

"A CVSS 10 on an isolated dev box < CVSS 6 on your payment processor"

*Math moment*: "CVSS is logarithmic, but cloud risk is exponential"

**BEAT 2: Modern Risk Scoring** (Expert - 2.5 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Risk formula with variables]*

"Real risk calculation:"
```
Risk = (CVSS × Exploitability × Exposure × Blast Radius) / Compensating Controls
```

*Factors*:
- EPSS score (likelihood of exploitation)
- Internet exposure (direct, indirect, none)
- Data sensitivity (PII, PCI, public)
- Identity privileges (admin, user, service)
- Compensating controls (WAF, network isolation)

**BEAT 3: Fortune 500 Case Study** (Expert - 2 minutes)
*[SLIDE: Before/after metrics]*

"Major retailer, 100K+ vulnerabilities:"

*Before prioritization*:
- Patching everything critical (impossible)
- 200 hours/week effort
- Still got breached (medium CVE, internet-facing)
