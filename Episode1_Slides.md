## SLIDE 1A: Modern Security Implementation vs Legacy Methods

**Title:** "What does 'security best practice' actually mean today?"

**Left Side - Legacy Methods: Static, Manual, Periodic**
üìã Manual checklist approach
‚Ä¢ Quarterly vulnerability scans
‚Ä¢ Annual policy reviews
‚Ä¢ Manual configuration checks
‚Ä¢ Human-scale administration
‚Ä¢ Reactive incident response
‚Ä¢ Point-in-time compliance

**Right Side - Modern Implementation: Dynamic, Automated, Continuous**
üîÑ Continuous verification loops
‚Ä¢ Real-time monitoring & validation
‚Ä¢ Policy as code
‚Ä¢ Automated configuration management
‚Ä¢ Programmatic control at scale
‚Ä¢ Proactive threat prevention
‚Ä¢ Continuous compliance

**Foundation:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework & SP 800-53 controls remain constant
**What Changed:** Our ability to implement them effectively at cloud scale and speed

**Key Implementation Shift:**
FROM: Manual, periodic validation
TO: Continuous, automated verification

## SLIDE 1B: Capital One Breach - Legacy Methods Failed Modern Infrastructure

**Title:** "Capital One 2019: 100M+ Customers Compromised"

**WAF Misconfiguration**
Web application firewall allowed SSRF attacks through improper configuration.
**Prevention:** Continuous monitoring (NIST SI-4) would catch WAF misconfigurations in minutes, not months.

**SSRF Attack & Metadata Service Exploit**
Attacker accessed AWS metadata service (169.254.169.254) to retrieve credentials.
**Prevention:** Zero trust verification (NIST AC-3) with IMDSv2 enforced by default would prevent credential access.

**Over-Permissioned IAM**
IAM role had excessive permissions, allowing access to multiple S3 buckets.
**Prevention:** Automated enforcement (NIST AC-2) would auto-remediate over-privileged roles and apply least privilege principles.

**106 Million Records Exposed**
Small misconfigurations created a highway to sensitive customer data.
**Prevention:** Defense in depth (NIST SC-7) with network segmentation would prevent lateral movement, limiting blast radius.

**Key Insight:** This wasn't sophisticated hacking - it was a failure to apply modern implementation methods to timeless security principles.

**The Fix:** Same NIST 800-53 controls, implemented with continuous automation instead of periodic manual processes.

## SLIDE 1C: AWS Security Design Principles - Scale Makes Them Essential

**Title:** "Seven Principles for Modern Security Implementation"

**AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar Design Principles:**

**1. Implement a strong identity foundation**
‚Ä¢ Least privilege by default, centralized identity management, eliminate static credentials

**2. Maintain traceability**  
‚Ä¢ Real-time monitoring, automated alerting, integrated log collection and response

**3. Apply security at all layers**
‚Ä¢ Defense in depth across network, compute, application, and data layers

**4. Automate security best practices**
‚Ä¢ Security as code, version-controlled templates, automated scaling of security controls

**5. Protect data in transit and at rest**
‚Ä¢ Classification-based protection, encryption, tokenization, granular access controls

**6. Keep people away from data**
‚Ä¢ Reduce direct access, eliminate manual processing, automated data handling

**7. Prepare for security events**
‚Ä¢ Incident response automation, simulation exercises, rapid detection and recovery

**Core Message:** These aren't cloud-specific - they're what good security looks like when you can finally implement it properly

**The Scale Factor:** Cloud infrastructure makes these principles essential, not optional

## SLIDE 2D: The Power of Context

**Title:** "Context Changes Everything: Same Vulnerability, Different Risk"

**Key Message:** "CNAPP sees all contexts and prioritizes accordingly"

**Same Vulnerability in Three Contexts:**
1. **Dev Environment (Internal Only)** ‚Üí LOW RISK
2. **Production Behind WAF** ‚Üí MEDIUM RISK  
3. **Internet-Facing with Admin Credentials** ‚Üí CRITICAL RISK

**Beginner Analogy:** "It's like having a broken lock - dangerous on your front door, not so much on your garden shed"

**Intermediate Insight:** "Same CVE-2023-1234, three different business impacts"

**Expert Insight:** "This is why legacy VM scanners fail - they see the vulnerability but miss the context that determines actual risk"

**Core Value:** Context-aware risk prioritization based on exposure and blast radius

---

## SLIDE 3A: Question 3 - Cloud VM Challenges

**Question:** "Why is VM harder in the cloud?"

**Lifecycle Comparison:**
‚Ä¢ Traditional Server: 3-5 years
‚Ä¢ Virtual Machine: 30-90 days  
‚Ä¢ Container: 12 minutes
‚Ä¢ Serverless Function: 100 milliseconds

**Key Message:** "Your quarterly scan cycle? Useless. That container you found vulnerable was terminated and replaced 10,000 times."

**Expert Insight:** "Auto-scaling means vulnerabilities multiply instantly. One vulnerable image becomes 100 vulnerable instances in minutes."

## SLIDE 3B: Equifax Breach - Cloud Migration Failure

**Title:** "Equifax 2017: When Cloud Migration Broke Vulnerability Management"

**Impact Stats:**
‚Ä¢ 147 million Americans affected
‚Ä¢ $700M+ in fines
‚Ä¢ CEO resigned, congressional hearings
‚Ä¢ Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638 (4-month patch delay)

**Cloud VM Failure Timeline:**
**Step 1:** Cloud Migration Visibility Gap
- Dispute resolution portal moved to AWS auto-scaling
- Traditional scanners lost track during migration

**Step 2:** Hybrid Environment Confusion  
- Mixed on-premises and cloud systems
- No unified scanning across hybrid infrastructure

**Step 3:** Auto-scaling Vulnerability Multiplication
- Vulnerable AMI deployed to multiple instances
- Quarterly scans couldn't keep up with dynamic instances

**Step 4:** Context Blindness
- Internet-facing portal treated as internal system
- No risk-based prioritization for cloud-exposed assets

**Step 5:** Extended Dwell Time
- 76 days of undetected lateral movement
- No runtime protection for cloud workloads

**Key Message:** "147 million records exposed because traditional VM couldn't handle cloud speed and scale"

---

## SLIDE 3C: Velocity vs Security Dilemma

**Title:** "The Fundamental Math That Breaks Traditional Vulnerability Management"

**Velocity Mismatch Visualization:**
‚Ä¢ **Infrastructure Deploy:** 5 minutes
‚Ä¢ **Vulnerability Scan:** 3 days to complete
‚Ä¢ **Security Review Process:** 3 weeks
‚Ä¢ **Quarterly Compliance Audit:** 3 months

**Real World Example:**
"We spin up 500 new containers every hour during peak traffic. Our vulnerability scan runs once a week and takes 12 hours to complete. We're literally scanning infrastructure that no longer exists."

**The Equifax Connection:**
"Their quarterly scan cycle was perfect for servers that lived for years. But when they moved to auto-scaling groups that created new instances every few minutes, those quarterly scans became completely irrelevant."

**Key Insight:** "Traditional security cadence was designed for static infrastructure. When your infrastructure velocity is measured in minutes, your security velocity must match - or you're always fighting yesterday's war."

**The Solution:** "Continuous automated validation that moves at infrastructure speed."

## SLIDE 12: Context Changes Everything

**Title:** "Same Vulnerability, Different Risk: Apache Struts in Context"

**Same Apache Struts Vulnerability in Different Contexts:**
1. **Internal Dev Environment** ‚Üí LOW RISK
   - Not internet-facing, development data only

2. **Corporate Intranet** ‚Üí MEDIUM RISK  
   - Behind VPN, internal employee access

3. **Customer-Facing Portal (Equifax)** ‚Üí CRITICAL RISK
   - Internet exposure + 147M PII records

**Formula:** "Risk = CVSS √ó Exposure √ó Blast Radius"

**Key Message:** "Cloud VM isn't just about finding vulnerabilities - it's about understanding exposure and blast radius"

**Equifax's Mistake:** "Treating an internet-facing customer portal the same as an internal system"

**Poll Question:** "What's your biggest cloud VM challenge?"
- Can't keep up with infrastructure changes
- Too many false positives to prioritize
- Don't know what cloud assets we have
- Traditional tools miss cloud services

---

## SLIDE 13: Question 4 - Visibility
