**Traditional Best Practice:**
• Patch Monthly
• Scan Quarterly
• Update Firewalls
• Annual Review
• Static Compliance

**Cloud Best Practice:**
• Continuous Validation
• Real-time Response
• Automated Enforcement
• Always Adapting
• Continuous Adaptation

**Key Message:** "The Paradigm Shift"
**Analogy:** "Security guard vs. smart building"

## SLIDE 3: Capital One - Traditional vs Cloud Best Practices

**Title:** "Capital One: The Cost of Cloud Misconfigurations

**What They Had (Traditional):**
✓ WAF deployed for perimeter security
✓ Security tools and monitoring
✓ Compliance certifications  
✓ Incident response team
✓ Regular vulnerability scanning

**What They Missed (Cloud-Native):**
✗ Continuous validation (config drifted for months)
✗ Zero trust (trusted the WAF too much)
✗ Automated enforcement (no IMDSv2)
✗ Least privilege (over-permissioned IAM)
✗ Defense in depth (no network segmentation)

**Impact:** "100M records exposed"
**Key Insight:** "Not sophisticated hacking - configuration drift and over-privileged access"

---

## SLIDE 4: Capital One Attack Path with Prevention Points

**Title:** "How Cloud Best Practices Would Have Prevented It"

**Attack Flow:**
1. WAF Misconfiguration →
2. SSRF Attack → 
3. Metadata Service → 
4. IAM Credentials → 
5. 100M Records

**Prevention Points:**
- "Continuous Validation" → Would catch WAF misconfig in minutes
- "Zero Trust" → IMDSv2 enforced by default
- "Automated Enforcement" → Auto-remediate over-privileged roles
- "Least Privilege" → WAF gets minimal permissions only
- "Defense in Depth" → Network segmentation prevents lateral movement

**Bottom Message:** "This wasn't sophisticated hacking - it was a failure to apply cloud-native thinking"

---

## SLIDE 5: Question 2 - CNAPP

**Question:** "CNAPP: The final boss of acronyms?"
**Sub-question:** "What problem does it solve?"

**Tool Sprawl Problem:**
- Browser with multiple tabs:
  • SIEM | Splunk
  • CSPM | Prisma
  • Qualys VMDR
  • CrowdStrike
  • GitHub Security
  • [15 more tools...]
- Counter: "23 tools = 23 logins = 23 alert streams"

## SLIDE 6: Uber Breach + CNAPP Solution

**Title:** "Uber 2016: When Tools Don't Talk

**Tool Blind Spots:**
- GitHub (credentials) ← "Scanner missed private repo"
- AWS Access ← "SIEM saw activity, no context"
- S3 Buckets ← "VM scanner not checking"
- Data Theft ← "No tool connected the dots"

**CNAPP Solution:**
Central hub with unified components:
• CSPM (Configurations)
• CWPP (Workloads)
• CIEM (Identity)
• IaC Security (Code)

**Context Power:**
Same CVE in different contexts:
1. Dev environment → LOW
2. Production + WAF → MEDIUM
3. Internet-facing + Admin → CRITICAL

**Key:** "Context-aware prioritization"

## SLIDE 8: The Power of Context

**Title:** "Context Changes Everything: Same Vulnerability, Different Risk"

**Key Message:** "CNAPP sees all contexts and prioritizes accordingly"

**Same Vulnerability in Three Contexts:**
1. **Dev Environment (Internal Only)** → LOW RISK
2. **Production Behind WAF** → MEDIUM RISK  
3. **Internet-Facing with Admin Credentials** → CRITICAL RISK

**Beginner Analogy:** "It's like having a broken lock - dangerous on your front door, not so much on your garden shed"

**Intermediate Insight:** "Same CVE-2023-1234, three different business impacts"

**Expert Insight:** "This is why legacy VM scanners fail - they see the vulnerability but miss the context that determines actual risk"

**Core Value:** Context-aware risk prioritization based on exposure and blast radius

---

## SLIDE 9: Question 3 - Cloud VM Challenges

**Question:** "Why is VM harder in the cloud?"

**Lifecycle Comparison:**
• Traditional Server: 3-5 years
• Virtual Machine: 30-90 days  
• Container: 12 minutes
• Serverless Function: 100 milliseconds

**Key Message:** "Your quarterly scan cycle? Useless. That container you found vulnerable was terminated and replaced 10,000 times."

**Expert Insight:** "Auto-scaling means vulnerabilities multiply instantly. One vulnerable image becomes 100 vulnerable instances in minutes."

## SLIDE 10: Equifax Breach - Cloud Migration Failure

**Title:** "Equifax 2017: When Cloud Migration Broke Vulnerability Management"

**Impact Stats:**
• 147 million Americans affected
• $700M+ in fines
• CEO resigned, congressional hearings
• Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638 (4-month patch delay)

**Cloud VM Failure Timeline:**
**Step 1:** Cloud Migration Visibility Gap
- Dispute resolution portal moved to AWS auto-scaling
- Traditional scanners lost track during migration

**Step 2:** Hybrid Environment Confusion  
- Mixed on-premises and cloud systems
- No unified scanning across hybrid infrastructure

**Step 3:** Auto-scaling Vulnerability Multiplication
- Vulnerable AMI deployed to multiple instances
- Quarterly scans couldn't keep up with dynamic instances

**Step 4:** Context Blindness
- Internet-facing portal treated as internal system
- No risk-based prioritization for cloud-exposed assets

**Step 5:** Extended Dwell Time
- 76 days of undetected lateral movement
- No runtime protection for cloud workloads

**Key Message:** "147 million records exposed because traditional VM couldn't handle cloud speed and scale"

## SLIDE 11: Cloud VM Visibility Gap Matrix

**Title:** "What Different Scanning Approaches Actually See in Cloud"

**Visibility Matrix:**
|                    | Agent | Network | API-Based |
|--------------------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Long-lived VMs     | ✓     | ✓       | ✓         |
| Auto-scaling VMs   | ~     | ✗       | ✓         |
| Containers         | ~     | ✗       | ✓         |
| Serverless         | ✗     | ✗       | ✓         |
| PaaS Services      | ✗     | ✗       | ✓         |

**Key Stat:** "If you're only using agents, you're blind to 60% of cloud infrastructure"

**Expert Insight:** "Equifax's traditional scanners were agent-based. They never saw the cloud instances that mattered most."

---

## SLIDE 12: Context Changes Everything

**Title:** "Same Vulnerability, Different Risk: Apache Struts in Context"

**Same Apache Struts Vulnerability in Different Contexts:**
1. **Internal Dev Environment** → LOW RISK
   - Not internet-facing, development data only

2. **Corporate Intranet** → MEDIUM RISK  
   - Behind VPN, internal employee access

3. **Customer-Facing Portal (Equifax)** → CRITICAL RISK
   - Internet exposure + 147M PII records

**Formula:** "Risk = CVSS × Exposure × Blast Radius"

**Key Message:** "Cloud VM isn't just about finding vulnerabilities - it's about understanding exposure and blast radius"

**Equifax's Mistake:** "Treating an internet-facing customer portal the same as an internal system"

**Poll Question:** "What's your biggest cloud VM challenge?"
- Can't keep up with infrastructure changes
- Too many false positives to prioritize
- Don't know what cloud assets we have
- Traditional tools miss cloud services

---

## SLIDE 13: Question 4 - Visibility

**Question:** "How do I get visibility into cloud risk?"

**Dependency Web (Azure VM example):**
Center: Azure VM connected to:
• → Network Interface
• → NSG
• → Managed Disks
• → Load Balancer
• → Public IP
• → DNS Entry

**Counter:** "1 action = 7+ resources"

**Shadow IT Stat:** "40% of resources are 'shadow IT'"
