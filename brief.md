│   1.  Critique my current plan so far.  Don't just agree with me, challenge me.  How can I make it better.\   │
│   2.  Help me create a full plan for both episodes.\                                                          │
│   3.  While I'm talking I don't want to show normal slides, but rather interesting slides about some classic  │
│   breaches that help reinforce the points I'm making for each answer.  Perhaps this is a bad idea and you     │
│   have a better one.  I want something to show, but I don't want to run a lecture either.\                    │
│   4.  Help me work on ways to make it interesting to a range of experience levels.  I don't want beginners to be completely lost and exports to be totally bored.  How can I do that?
